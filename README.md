# easygdal

A python wrapper for gdal with batteries (libgdal) included.

> Note: Conda users should use gdal and libgdal packages from `defaults` or `conda-forge`. This project is for pip/pypi users who need a simpler setup process. [Conda packages](https://gdal.org/en/stable/download.html#conda) are fully-supported on all platforms.

The processes used to construct these wheels were influenced heavily by https://gitlab.com/mentaljam/gdal-wheels.
